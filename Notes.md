# Notes:

- [ ] Finish the [[Prototype app]] program.
	- [x] Pok√©mon & Move Name
	- [x] Move Base Power
	- [x] Develop a txt file to store single type effectiveness of Pok√©mon of a single type. 
		- Note: This also works for dual type pokemon, refer to [[Notes#8-9-23]]
	- [ ] Pok√©mon type effectiveness needs:
		- [x] Attacking Move base power
		- [ ] Attacking Move type
		- [ ] Defending Pok√©mon type(s) {Single type and Dual type}
	- [x] ‚ùó**Find a method to implement the dual type Pok√©mon chart**‚ùó**Found!** üòÅ
	- [ ] Use Type Chart Function to Calculate Effectiveness of Move
		- [ ] No effect (0%) *No damage*
		- [ ] Not very effective (50%) *Cuts base power by half*
		- [ ] Normal (100%) *Normal base power*
		- [ ] Super-effective (200%) *Doubles base power*
- [ ] Develop the front end and the back end (after the [[Prototype app]] is done)
	- [ ] Use flask and python to make a webapp of the [[Prototype app]]

#### _07/06/2023_ 
#### Pyscript and Flask:
Well, I just found out about pyscript. I think I'm still going to use
Flask though. There's two reasons for it. One: to learn how to use it.
I'm planning on making a website that rates a university department's
courses **[NOT PROFESSORS]**. So I'll continue working with flask, but
I need to remember pyscript so I can learn how to use it for simple stuff.

#### PaaS and other cloud environments:
Huh, it looks like the back end of sites is a bit complicated. I'm still
a bit confused on one thing. Is this where the site is launching? Environments with PaaS are run online on servers, but I have no idea
if it actually launches a server. So I think they do launch the website.
So, the two PaaS that I'm looking into to use are https://caprover.com and https://dokku.com 
It looks like I can develop as I go for dokku, so I think that one 
might be the bese one for me since I want to make sure I can develop 
it... in real time if I need to.
On another note, I stumbled on this https://asciinema.org/ it records from the terminal and it's free.
^ It's pretty cool, neat, and useful.
Lastly, this https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ is also an option.
Here are others to consider: https://medium.com/@theHocineSaad/heroku-is-no-longer-free-here-are-the-best-alternatives-1c22d814e51d
	

#### NEW PLAN:
Develop the application with github and flask, but find a remote server or make
a local server to launch the site. There's no exception.

#### 06/24/23: Can't run flask.
So I can't use flask because it launches a server on its own. 
That is the issue. So since the plan is to launch this app
with GitHub pages, I guess my only choice is to learn how to 
use php.
CORRECTION: GitHub Pages only supports static websites. Static websites
are websites that display content exactly as it's stored in the system it's
serving it from. So..... I can still make it with flask, but I won't be able
to launch it through GitHub pages, instead a remote server or a local server 
woule work best. Well, that is a dealbreaker.

#### 06/23/23: Flask resources
Just a couple of recources to learn flask.
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-web-application-using-flask-and-deploy-it-to-the-cloud-3551c985e492/
https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/quickstart/


#### 06/22/23: front end
Since the back end is experiencing some... issues ;-; it's time to get back to working on the
front end, at least for now. One thing for sure, I'd love to make this more modern.
But how?! I also need to figure out how to use python and flask. So I guess that's what I'll
do next. 

#### 06/16/23: pokeAPI Changes
I legigimately have no idea why, but I can't use the get_pokemon function from the aiopoke api.
So, I'm considering using another pokemon api wrapper to get this data.

Here is the link the the api wrapper I'm considering:
https://pokeapi.github.io/pokepy/usage/#api
Here is the link to the repo:
https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokepy

Thankfully, I haven't delved too far into this project- and it doesn't look like this one uses asyncio,
so it'll be less of a hassle. It also looks like it was made by Paul Hallett, who was the founder of the
the original pokeapi... so I probably should have gone with this more stable version- I don't know why 
get_pokemon isn't working... it worked before, but here we are now. I'll make the change by Monday.



#### 06/06/23
So, I've organized a way to input a pokemon's moves and created a way to dump all their moves.
The next steps are as shown below:
	- Search moves' base damage | Make another dict with the id and the move's base damage?
	- Develop type chart matrix, function, and txt file to read from.
	- Search moves on type chart in comparison against opposing pokemon.
		+ sort move effectiveness in a max and min heap for each pokemon. (2 min and 2 max)


#### 06/05/23
There are a couple of things that I could make. I could make a map to store
all of the relevant information regarding some pokemon. In addition, I could also 
use a max and a min heap to filter the max and min damage
of each move to the pokemon against each of them.
	- General database <- where everything is stored
	- It'd make sense to store the id's instead of all the dadta, faster? 
		+ max damage database <- where id's are stored and they're ordered from max to min
		+ min damage database <- where id's are stored and they're ordered from in to max

#### 06/04/23
Success! I've parsed the string up to the move name. There's two things that
I need to do now. I need to make a hash map or a map or sorts to 
insert the id and the name of the move onto with the key.

#### 05/31/23
As of now, I've discovered that 
(- now that I think about it, I should consider using jupyter notebooks, 
but md is good to learn too, but anyway,) when I retrieve pokemon.moves on lines 59 
and 60, it actually retrieves a... something that I think is a json object. Notice output.txt. 
I've been messing with the main python file and trying to figure out 
how to parse through it, but the issue is that it doesn't read each character of 
each line, instead it sort of reads an object...?
Anyway, here are some links to get started researching:

#### ??/??/23:
Look for these sections in the api:
	Use Moves:Moves section
	Use Moves:Moves Damage Classes
	Use Moves:Moves Ailments


Need to make a pokemon type chart function.

one is fine, another one might be better:
