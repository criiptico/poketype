# Back-end design
    - A couple of housekeeping things I still need to do:
        + Verify you can input pokemon
            - Verify you can retrieve the moves that are effective with that pokemon. This is sorted with respect to the type of move (which is its effectiveness) and how much damage the move actually does.
                - Filter for move type
                - Filter for move damage
    + On the design side, I plan on making an adjacency matrix that will work where I'll hard-code (since there's no api for it, I need to do it myself.) OR I could also load it in with a txt file, parse it, then input it into the matrix. Though, the purpose of the matrix is for the pokemon move type effectiveness. See: https://pokemondb.net/type

# Front-end design
    - Not so much of a priority. But to note, missing instructions, forms, processing, and output.
