# Notes:
##### 05/31/23
	As of now, I've discovered that 
	(- now that I think about it, I should consider using jupyter notebooks, 
	but md is good to learn too, but anyway,) when I retrieve pokemon.moves on lines 59 
	and 60, it actually retrieves a... something that I think is a json object. Notice output.txt. 
	I've been messing with the main python file and trying to figure out 
	how to parse through it, but the issue is that it doesn't read each character of 
	each line, instead it sort of reads an object...?
	Anyway, here are some links to get started researching:

##### ??/??/23:
	Look for these sections in the api:
		Use Moves:Moves section
		Use Moves:Moves Damage Classes
		Use Moves:Moves Ailments


	Need to make a pokemon type chart function.

	Read this article to learn to make a better makefile, even though this 
	one is fine, another one might be better:
